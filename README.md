# Stress-variations-within-fault-damage-zone

This package is to calculate the variations of stress and effective properties in fractured rock mass representative of fault damage zone. Please refer to Zhang and Ma (2021) for more details.

Fault damage zone is idealized as a 2D multilayer model including fractal macroscopic fractures with different densities through layers.

This package mainly includes two parts:
1) Generation of discrete fracture network, with fracture length following double power law;
2) Given applied far-field stress, calculate fracture deformation and stress changes.
